**Project Summary:** A QR-code alternative to quickly access websites with no hassle. Simply take a photo of a website from posters or bilboards and you are ready to go! You can also save the links for your reference.

**Main features/Development ideas:** 
- Taking photograph of given website link and being automatically redirected to that website
- Storing list of past links
- Traking most popular spots for business opportunities
- Upgrade to word-recognition for website suggestions, as opposed to website links solely.

**Current state:**
- A simple prototype using Microsoft Computer Vision APi was created, to be replaced by Tess Two OCR for image recognition
- Photo-taking ability applied (needs debugging)
- A separate note taking prototype app was developed, to be added to the main project
