**Project Summary:** A QR-code alternative to quickly access websites with no hassle. Simply take a photo of a website from posters or bilboards and you are ready to go! You can also save the links for your reference.

**Main features/Development ideas:** 
- Taking photograph of given website link and being automatically redirected to that website
- Storing list of past links
- Upgrade to word-recognition for website suggestions, as opposed to website links solely.

**Technology:**
- A sample was made using Microsoft Computer Vision API, currently in process of replacing with Tess Two library.
